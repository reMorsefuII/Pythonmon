Hello to whoever's reading this!  
This is **Pythonmon**, the sh###iest game money *cant* buy! (because it's free)  

It's a horrible parody of Pokemon that I challenged myself to make in order to learn Python (the arguably easiest language to learn, I'm ashamed it took too long)  
I don't expect to see anyone reading this or looking at the source code, but to YOU (whoever you may be):  


Thanks for checking this out. Enjoy.
